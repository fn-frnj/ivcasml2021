Compilation of assignments from International Virtual Course Astrostatistics and Machine Learning 2021 held by ITB &amp; NARIT

# Individual Assignment

1. Project 1 : Galaxies classification based on the regression of its brightness (magnitude) in different wavelengths. (keywords =  regression, model training)
2. Project 2 : Galaxies distance (redshift) estimation based on the regression of its color-color diagram (magnitude). (keywords = regresion, neural networks training)
3. Hands-on 6 August : Time series analysis of binary system DT Vir lightcurve (keywords =  time series analysis)
4. Hands-on 9 August : Galaxies clustering, finding center of galaxy clusters, making 2D kernel, spline regression of color-magnitude diagram (CMD). (keywords = clustering, centroid determination, spline regression)

# Group Assignments
(Group 5); regression of eight Freidmann models. (keywords = regression modeling, nested sampling, corner plot).
